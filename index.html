				    <h2>History of OSM</h2>
				    <h4>OpenStreetMap was founded in 2005 by Steve Coast.  He was frustrated that large government-run, tax-funded projects like the Ordence Survey had huge datasets but did not distrubute them in a free, easy manner.</h4>
				    <h4>On August 22nd, 2006 the OSM Foundation was etablished to encourage the growth, development and distrobution of OSM and its data.</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="./baltoContoursv2.png">
				    <h2>History of OSM continued...</h2>
				    <h4>JOSM, the offline editor ws created on Jan 22, 2006 and on December 4th, 2006 Yahoo! ariel imagery was allowed to be traced.</h4>
				    <h4>Now there are 5 million registered users with 1 million of them contributing to the map.</h4>

				    <h2>OSM + Humanitarian/Dev</h2>
				    <h4>The importance of OSM in humanitarian aid and development was made clear by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The data generated in the earthquake's immediate aftermath quickly became the most authortative available.</h4>
				    <h4>Builing on this momentum the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) was encorporated.</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="./baltoContoursv5.png">
				    <h2>OSM + Humanitarian/Dev II</h2>
				    <h4>With the success of HOT following Haiti many international organizations recognized the value of OSM.  Overtime the RedCross, Peace Corps, MSF, The Department of State, and USAID developed programs to map and use OSM data.</h4>

		From the early days of OpenStreetMap it was anticipated that open, free map data would be a tremendous benefit for humanitarian aid and economic development. The idea was proven during the Haiti earthquake in 2010. HOT was incorporated in the immediate aftermath, August 2010, as a U.S. nonprofit, and then became a registered 501(c)3 charitable organization in 2013. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the HOT mission via our Tasking Manager. All you need is an OpenStreetMap Username.
While you participate, we ask that you do your best to uphold the code of conduct of our community. See our HOT Community Code of Conduct.
